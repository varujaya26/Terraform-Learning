terraform init #initializes the terraform
terraform plan #shows the planning of the resources to deploy
terraform apply -auto-approve #applies the terraform, -auto-approve is to eliminate yes
terraform destroy -auto-approve #destroys the terraform, -auto-approve is to eliminate yes 
terraform apply -var-file=stage.tfvars # Loads a new .tfvars instead of default one

not changes it
