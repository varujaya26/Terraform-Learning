Create EC2 Instance using TF

$Create a sample.tf file with the provider name 
And resource
$ Clone the directory and open in vs code terminal
$ terraform init # Initialize terraform
$ terraform plan # like a dry-run, shows what is created using the file
$ terraform apply
An EC2 instance is created.
$ Added .tfstate and .backup file to .gitignore
.tfstate is a file that records all terraform infrastructure details
To delete the created infra
$terraform destroy

Hence the Lifecycle of terraform is 
$terraform init
$terraform plan
$terraform apply
$terraform destroy
